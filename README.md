# Debian Packaging Practice

This repository showcases a simple example of building and packaging a `.deb` file on a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu. The project includes a custom shell script (`hello.sh`) that outputs "Hello, World!" when executed, packaged into a Debian-compliant `.deb` archive.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of a hands-on exercise to understand the fundamentals of:

- Linux software packaging (specifically `.deb`)
- Debian control file structure
- Post-installation scripting
- Package metadata and filesystem layout
